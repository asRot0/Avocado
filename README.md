## Dataset Overview
The project uses the Avocado Price dataset from the Hass Avocado Board, which includes weekly retail data on the price and volume of Hass avocados. The dataset contains details like:

- **Date**: Observation date
- **AveragePrice**: Average price of an avocado
- **Type**: Conventional or organic
- **Region**: The city or region of observation
- **Volume Details**: Includes total and categorized volumes of avocados sold

This dataset provides insights into sales trends and regional price variations.

## Project Highlights
In this project, we:

1. **Explored the Dataset**: Performed detailed data visualization to uncover patterns and trends.
2. **Preprocessed Data**: Handled missing values, performed feature engineering, and scaled numerical features.
3. **Built Predictive Models**:
   - Linear Regression
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Decision Tree Regressor
   - Random Forest
   - XGBoost
   - CatBoost
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
4. **Evaluated Models**: Compared models using metrics like RMSE, MSE, and RÂ² to identify the best-performing algorithms.
5. **Interactive Dashboard**: Created an interactive visualization dashboard for deeper insights into avocado prices across regions.
